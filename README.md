# Adopt a Pet
## Project #50 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project is a pet adoption website that allows users to view all adptable pets of a particular species, as well as view each specific pet profile. The goal of this project was to add client-side routing to this React application.
## What I Learned
  - Further developed my understanding of React Router, covering concepts similar to the previous project (Project #49, React Router v5 Tutorial)
  - Creating routes by wrapping the application in a Router
  - Using the useParams hook to give components access to the values of the current URL parameters
  - Replacing the "a" HTML anchor element with React Router elements (Link & NavLink)
  - Adding useHistory, useLocation, and useEffect hooks to implement a search feature
